## Description

The Lightweight Document Scanner is a simple and efficient application that allows users to scan documents using their mobile device's camera and share it in formats like PDF and JPEG. The app leverages Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative UI and ML Kit Document Scanner Library from Google for powerful scanning capabilities. It can autometically detect the document so reduce much of the manual work of cropping and retakes, also it includes filters like color, grayscale, auto filter, shadow. Overall, this app creates high quiality scanned documents in less time. It does not store any of the document, not even in cache. So that app size will not increase overtime and security of your documents also preserved.
